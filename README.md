# SabermetricsFinalProject

## Project Proposal

Often in this class we have spent time talking about measuring a players contribution in terms of runs that the player in question is contributing to his team. We have done this in many ways. Some were inefficient such as counting RBIs, while others were better such as calculating how many runs an at bat was worth by run expectancy. One thing that I don’t think we have touched on enough is the ability of a player to create a productive out, meaning an out that resulted in a run or advanced base runner. I will be calling this statistic PrO%, or Productive Out Percentage. I believe this statistic would be an accurate metric to measure a player’s contribution to the “small ball” part of the game.

Given that the data I need will be in the form of play by play information, I will be using the same Retrosheet database that we have been using in the class. I will be pulling all plays in which the batter was up to bat with runners on second or third and less than two outs. I will consider this to be the plays in which a player has an opportunity to create a productive out and will call the total number of these plays per player PrOO or Productive Out Opportunities. I will then count the number of PrOOs in which the batter was ruled out but a run scored or a runner advanced. This count will be called Productive Outs or PrOs. Thus, PrO% will be calculated as indicated below:

PrO% =PrO/PrOO

To expand upon this idea, I am considering evolving the statistic to weight productive outs that result in runs heavier than those that merely advanced the base runner. I would also put emphasis on outs in which runners advanced and runs scored. I do not know what weights I would assign and it would most likely take a fair amount of tinkering to get right. For that reason I consider this to be a stretch goal for the project. I am considering using the ratio of run value for the two different kinds of at bats to weight them but that is just my preliminary idea.

To demonstrate this I am choosing to go with a simple approach. I have not touched web development for three years and will not have the time to refresh myself alongside finishing senior projects. For that reason, I am planning on creating a python application that will exist in the same directory as a csv file that will contain all of the necessary data. The application will prompt the user for the name of a player and will then fetch the PrO, PrOO, and PrO% for that player. The application will also display the percent of PrOs that resulted in runs, the number of that resulted in an advanced runner, and the number that resulted in both. This will be comprehensive for all players with data in the retrosheet regardless of position. To run this, it will be required that the user downloads the python script as well as the csv file and that they are stored within the same directory and the csv file’s name is not changed. This will be detailed in the README.

## Statistic Analysis

When I began evaluating this statistic I was expecting most players to be returing a very high success rate in creating productive outs. I believe this assumption came from my own personal frustrations as a baseball fans and watching players pop out with a man on third and one out, failing to create that crucial run. It was much to my surprise that most players were creating a producive outs at a relatively low rate. When looking at players with a minimum of 500 PrOOs, Elvis Andrus topped the PrO% ranking with 0.378 of his PrOOs resulting in productive at-bats. I was expecting good hitters to be able to create a productive out in about half of their opportunities. After all, all they really need to do is make contact right? Apparently not.

Looking at the statistics, I believe that, at least for most players, the PrO% is being weighed down by the inclusion of the "man on second" scenario. Advancing a man from second is simply not that easy. It most often either requires a decent smack to right field (most often by a left handed batter) or a well hit but slow rolling ground ball to the right side.
